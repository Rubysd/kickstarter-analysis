#KICKSTARTER ANALYSYS

PROJECT GENERAL DESCRIPTION

They provided us with some data and based on this we can draw conclusions about the Kickstarter campaigns for which we have different categories and based on a statistical analysis we can know which categories are more likely to be successful or which are the indicators that are telling us which ones. categories have lower results.

ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES EXPLAIN HOW YOU PERFORMED YOUR ANALYSIS USING IMAGES AND LINKS TO THE CODE, AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES YOU FOUND AND HOW YOU OVERCOME THEM. IF YOU DID NOT HAVE CHALLENGES, DESCRIBE THE POSSIBLE CHALLENGES OR DIFFICULTIES YOU MAY ENCOUNTER.

Using graphs greatly helped me to analyze my data in order to have a better understanding of it and give a more personalized conclusion of each data set.
This is not a huge amount of data but when we do have it, I imagine that many times the problems start from the steps to follow such as extracting, processing and grouping data in addition to analyzing this data to generate a good report, as I mentioned earlier this is not the case but it occurs in many others since the amount of data is enormous and coherence is lost for this reason the importance of knowing all our data, understanding it and thus being able to generate a complete and concise analysis of what is being requested of us.

WHAT ARE TWO CONCLUSIONS YOU CAN DRAW ABOUT THE THEATER'S RESULTS BY LAUNCH DATE?

The conclusions that I can draw about the theater's results by launch date are that the trend line that remains more linear without highs or lows is that of canceled campaigns in almost every month, we can see several canceled campaigns, generating in the table an average per month of 3 cancellations.
Subsequently, the failed campaigns that present a cyclical behavior, for example we can see an increase in the month of October, and this may be due to several factors, this is where analysts can give this result and attribute the result perhaps to a lack. preparation, or poor logistics etc.
Finally, in successful campaigns, we have a cyclical behavior with an increase in the month of May and it is the analyst's job to provide this data to determine why at that time we have more hits than in December and for example determine if they are causes that are under our control.

WHAT CAN YOU FIND ABOUT GOAL-BASED RESULTS?

It can be concluded that theater-related projects are the category that subsequently seeks funding, Music-related projects have more chances of success and less chance of failing with 80% vs 20% and we realized based on the graph that the project with less than 1000 goals you have a better chance of success.

WHAT ARE SOME LIMITATIONS OF THIS DATA SET?

I did not find many limitations in this dataset, but perhaps if I had to choose a few it would be that Excel is primarily two-dimensional and limits its ability to incorporate multiple variables at the same time.
For example, the use of an XY model is no longer considered suitable for some analysis, budgeting or even risk analysis, a more complex study would have to be created to determine the exact factors from the graphs.
And Excel does not have a native way to help you manage multiple worksheets in a simplified way. You would have to keep track of workbook names, templates, and data so you do not end up confused or overwhelmed. This scenario increases the probability of human error during project management and data analysis.

WHAT ARE SOME OTHER POSSIBLE TABLES AND / OR GRAPHS WE COULD CREATE?

Perhaps we could create more charts with a future forecast since, as we see, we have past data and we could create a future forecast based on a double average, a simple average or exponential smoothing and we could use a line chart again or also one The objective of this would be to test factors that make the campaigns successful, failed or successful and seeing how the line behaves we will see if our forecasts have any effect on the trend line.
